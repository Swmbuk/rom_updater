# rom_updater
Command line script to replace curated folders of ROM files and save the lists
as CSVs.

### Summary

I created the script to make the task of updating ROM files in my RetroPie setup
easier. Personally I prefer to only keep my favorite ROMs together as opposed to
storing every ROM from a set and having to scroll through a lot of bloat.

This creates a problem when you wish to update your ROM set as you will need to
manually curate the ROMs again. This script therefore takes your old ROMs in a
directory and uses this to find replacements in a new directory of a full new ROM
set.
